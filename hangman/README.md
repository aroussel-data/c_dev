# Hangman game

This is a small learning project, mainly to familiarise myself with:
- File input
- User input
- Pointers
- String.h

Improvements to be made:
- Secure user input by replacing scanf with fgets in order to prevent buffer overflow exploits
- Find a way of matching letters that occur more than twice in one word that doesn't just involve adding more conditions
